# QA-DevOps-SFIA_1-Project

### Project Introduction
<hr>
For this project, I was asked to make an online application using a Flask framework. It needed to have CRUD funtionality, meaning that a user should be able to create, read, update and delete user input data. The data itself had to be stored externally in a MySQL database and should include at least two tables that share a one-to-many relationship.
